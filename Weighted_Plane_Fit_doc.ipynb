    "# Weighted_LS_Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "This code estimates the slope of digital elevation data by performing a weighted least squares plane fit over a window around each point in the data. The weighting is defined by a 2D Hann function applied over the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:  \n",
    "- FFTW 3.3.8\n",
    "- GDAL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs:   \n",
    "##### Window Size  \n",
    "The window size is the number of samples along one edge of the window. I.E. the window is a winSize by winSize matrix. The window size must be a positive, odd integer with a value greater than or equal to 5.  \n",
    "##### DEM Size (Only needed for .hgt files)\n",
    "The DEM size is the number of samples along one edge of the data image. It is required to provide this because, unlike geotiff, there is no metadata in .hgt files that specifies the array dimensions for the data. This must be specified for rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pixel Size (Only needed for .hgt files)\n",
    "This is the pixel size, measured in meters, of each pixel. This must be specified for both the x and y directions. The slope estimation algorithm does not allow for a sizes to be individually assigned to each pixel. Therefore, the average size should be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs:  \n",
    "The writeFile function generates a geotiff file with elevation in band1, slope in band2, and aspect in band3. run_WLS_plane_fit_geotiff calls this function as part of its routine. The array of slope/aspect values is valid at all points other than those within (winSize-1)/2 samples from the edge. This is because the window does not fully encompass the elevation data near the edges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Bindings  \n",
    "A python interface is provided for the purpose of generating data from geotiff files containing elevation data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To import the module, use\n",
    "`import Weighted_LS_Plane`\n",
    "\n",
    "To run calculations, use\n",
    "`success = Weighted_LS_Plane.run_WLS_plane_fit_geotiff(winSize, inFilePath, outFilePath)`\n",
    "\n",
    "success (return value): True if calculations were successful, false otherwise  \n",
    "winSize: window size\n",
    "inFilePath: path to the geotiff file containing elevation data  \n",
    "outFilePath: path of the file containing the results  \n",
    "\n",
    "The python bindings were generated using SWIG. For more information, see http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html#Python_nn49\n",

    "##### Accessing the SRTM Data\n",
    "The SRTM version 3.0 data is located at\n",
    "`/nex/datapool/srtmgl1/SRTMGL1.003/`  \n",
    "The .hgt files for version 3.0 are compressed in .zip format. Therefore, it is necessary to first extract the desired file and place it into the dem_data folder.\n"
